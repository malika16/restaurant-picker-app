# Restaurant Picker App

# Features

1. Create a Session: The app allows a user to create a session, becoming the initiator. A session Id will be generated at backend and is used abstractly in the front end code.

2. Join a Session: Initiators can invite others to join the session. 

3. Submit a Restaurant: Once in a session, users can submit their restaurant of choice.

4. View Submitted Restaurants: All users within the session can view the list of submitted restaurants. Backend api is used to fetch all restaurants added against the same session id

5. End a Session: The session initiator can end the session, which triggers the random selection of a restaurant from the submitted list.
