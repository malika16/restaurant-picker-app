# Restaurant Picker App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a web application designed and built to meet the following requirements:

1.A user can initiate a session and invite others to join it.
2.Other users who have joined the session may submit a restaurant of their choice.
3.All users in the session are able to see restaurants that others have submitted.
4.The user who initiated the session is able to end the session.
    a. At the end of a session, a restaurant is randomly picked from all submitted restaurants. All users in the session are then able to see the picked restaurant.
    b. A user should not be able to join a session that has already ended.
